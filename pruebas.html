            <p class="testimonials-text">OMG, we are so blessed to have selected Juan David and his team as our broker to list & 
              sell our challenging property in FL. From the initial consult through the many showings,
               negotiations, and contingencies; they met each challenge with alacrity and ingenuity. It just
               doesn’t get better. We have years of real estate experience in many markets and they are
               certainly among the most professional, diligent, and resourceful we have ever worked with.
               Plus, Clever Home Selling donates a portion of its commission to local philanthropic causes
               too just icing on the cake in our opinion. Please give Juan David and the Clever Home Selling
               team your most serious consideration</p>
